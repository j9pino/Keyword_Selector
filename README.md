# Keyword_Selector
This Streamlit app is meant for users to export a list of articles from the Scopus database and identify the "keywords" for each article. The user must import a CSV file with at least the default columns of Title, Abstract, Author Keywords, and Index Keywords. The app will aggregate the values in each column (removing stopwords, numbers, and punctuation) and export a new CSV file that may be used with visualization tools like VOSViewer. An additional function of the app is to export the top 1,000 "keywords" from the overall list.
